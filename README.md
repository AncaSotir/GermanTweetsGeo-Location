In addition to the two regression models presented, two different feature extraction methods were used. 
More concretely, the first approach consists of extracting word vectors using spaCy model for German written text and applying SVR; 
the second approach consists of using a simple neural network with an embedding layer.

The .py files and the documentation for this project can be found on this repository.
